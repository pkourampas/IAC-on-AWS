# How Terraform works

It creates and manages resources on cloud platforms through their APIs (Application Programming Interface). 

The core Terraform workflow consists of three stages:

- Write (Define Infra in configuration files).
- Plan (Review the changes Terraform will make to your infrastructure).
- Apply (Provisions your infrastructure and update the state files).
